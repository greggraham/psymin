# Psymin

Psymin is an implementation of the Simon electronic game by Milton Bradley. It was written as an exercise in learning Processing, and was inspired by my first game programming project back in 1980. It was an implementation of Simon in Apple Integer BASIC that was lost due to a cassette tape failure.

This program requires the Beads audio library, which is available from [http://www.beadsproject.net/](http://www.beadsproject.net/).
